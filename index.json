Existing methods often overlook such communication constraints by assuming unrealistic global connectivity. Other works consider realistic hardware limitations that restrict communication range, requiring robots to maintain close proximity or line of sight for stable connectivity. For instance, preplanned rendezvous approaches are often inefficient due to unnecessary detours resulting from poorly timed rendezvous, while pursuit-based approaches are often short-sighted due to their greedy nature given the current state. We present $IR^2$, a deep reinforcement learning approach to information sharing for multi-robot exploration. Leveraging attention-based neural networks trained via reinforcement and curriculum learning, $IR^2$ allows robots to reason about the future impact of current decisions. In addition, we propose a hierarchical graph formulation to maintain a sparse yet informative graph, enabling our approach to scale to large-scale environments. We present simulation results in three large-scale Gazebo environments, which show that our approach yields $8.6 - 34.1%$ shorter exploration paths compared to state-of-the-art baselines, and leads to significantly improved map consistency among robots.

While existing methods typically aim to reduce communication throughput, they either require significant computation or significantly compromise exploration efficiency. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework based on communication and privileged reinforcement learning to achieve a significant reduction in bandwidth consumption, while minimally sacrificing exploration efficiency. Specifically, our approach allows robots to learn to embed the most salient information from their individual belief (partial map) over the environment into fixed-sized messages. Robots then reason about their own belief as well as received messages to distributedly explore the environment while avoiding redundant work. In doing so, we employ privileged learning and learned attention mechanisms to endow the critic (i.e., teacher) network with ground truth map knowledge to effectively guide the policy (i.e., student) network during training. Compared to relevant baselines, our model allows the team to reduce communication by up to two orders of magnitude, while only sacrificing a marginal 2.4% in total travel distance, paving the way for efficient, distributed multi-robot exploration in bandwidth-limited scenarios. We open-sourced our full code.
